## ContactManager App

## Check Live Preview - https://yashlonkar55.github.io/Contact-Manager-App/

This React application is a fully functional contact manager that allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) contacts. It utilizes React Router for efficient navigation and basic CSS for styling.

**Features**

- Create new contacts with name, email, phone number, and optional avatar image.
- View a list of all contacts with search functionality (optional).
- Edit existing contact information.
- Delete unwanted contacts.
- Navigate between the contact list and individual contact views using React Router.
- Basic CSS styling for a visually appealing interface.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-manager-app.git

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

**Development**

1. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

   This will start the development server, typically running at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Open this URL in your browser to access the app.

**Usage**

- The app initially displays a list of existing contacts.
- Use the form provided to create new contacts.
- Click on a contact to view its details and edit options.
- Use the edit form to update contact information.
- Click the delete button to remove a contact (confirmation will be prompted).

**React Router**

The app utilizes React Router to manage navigation between the contact list and individual contact views. Routes are likely defined within a `src/App.js` or similar component file. Specific route configurations and components handling each view should be documented within the code itself.

**Customization**

You can customize the app further by:

- Adding more features, such as sorting, filtering, or contact groups.
- Implementing more sophisticated styling using CSS frameworks or libraries.
- Integrating with external services for data storage, authentication, or other functionalities.
